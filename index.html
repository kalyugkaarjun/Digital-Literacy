        <h2>What are Digital Scams</h2>

<h3>
    Digital scams are increasingly prevalent in today's interconnected world, posing significant risks to individuals and organizations alike. 
    These scams encompass a wide range of deceptive practices carried out through digital means, such as email, social media, and websites. 
    Common digital scams include phishing, where cybercriminals impersonate trusted entities to trick individuals into revealing 
    sensitive information, and online fraud, which involves bogus online transactions or solicitations for monetary gain. 
Ransomware attacks,
     in which malicious software encrypts a victim's data until a ransom is paid, also continue to rise. Vigilance and digital literacy are 
     essential to protect against these scams, as well as using security measures like strong, unique passwords, two-factor authentication,
      and regularly updating security software. Staying informed about the latest scam techniques and being cautious when sharing personal information 
      online are crucial steps in safeguarding against digital scams. This is just a brief overview. I have made youtube videos if you are not sure how they work, how to install them
      or what they mean.
